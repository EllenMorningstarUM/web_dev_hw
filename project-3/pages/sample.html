     <p class="second-font">"So what's our advice? If you're being shamed about something, don't keep it to yourself. Secrecy feeds shame. When released into the open air, shame loses it's power. <i>Own your feelings, thoughts, opinions, viewpoints, and self-worth.</i> To feel shame you must relinquishownership of those things. Which is easy if you never felt true ownership over them in the first place. But how do we lose ownership of the very things that make us who we are?"</p></br>
