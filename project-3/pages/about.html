     <h3 class="text-under">Corrine Fisher</h3>
      <img src="../images/corinne.png" alt="Blunt Force" title="The One and Only" width="646" height="436" />
        <p class="color-title">Corrine is 1/2 of <i>Sorry About Lastnight</i> comedy duo. You can find her on the streets of Harlem walking her precious pup <i>Alfred</i> or on the stage at <i>Just for Laughs</i> comedy club. Notably Corrine is the gut busting blunt force on the GWF podcast. She made sure she didn't hold back in the book.

        <p class="second-font">"Until I began recording <i>Guys We Fucked</i> podcast, I really had no idea just how bad people felt themselves. As I like to bring up often, because I think it's one of her greatest comedic quotes, my mom has told me on more than one occasion that I have <i>"too much self-confidence."</i></p></br>

        <h3 class="text-under">Krystyna Hutchinson</h3>
          <img src="../images/krystyna.png" alt="The Optimist" title="Over-flowing" width="720" height="720" />
           <p class="color-title">Krystyna is the other 1/2 of <i>Sorry About Lastnight</i> comedy duo. You can find Krystyna with her long-time boyfriend <i>Stephen</i> trying out random sex clubs while on tour or interviewing possible threesome participants. She is known for her large voice and very concerning tone.</p></br>

           <p class="second-font">"Not only has my glass always been half-full, it's straight-up overflowing onto the floor. I'm the type of optimist who naively overestimates what I'm capable of. I was lucky enough to be raised by two parents I love and respect beyond words."</p></br>
