7. Digression: This week has ultimately been a real challenge. Leading me to many emails with Justine as well as a solid slack session. However,
   my website is not complete. I have all of my details and all of my layout, but I've had serious issues with getting my actual pages to load my css code.
   I've had no issues applying stylings to my index, I just can't get css to work for my documents in the pages. At least I tried, quite hard actually!
