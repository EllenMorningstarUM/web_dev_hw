Ending Project 3
The last few weeks have led my on a path of red wine and few face palms. Overall I tried my best; coding is not something I'm getting
the hang of and I'm okay with it. I don't plan on pursuing a career in coding or web design so I'm feeling pretty confident in what
I have learned and what I will forget by the time next semester rolls around. Not trying to be negative, just being incredibly honest.
I couldn't figure quite a bit out this week, like how to get more than one style sheet on an html page etc etc. Thankfully, Justine
was able to help me out so I could get the hang of it. 52 hours later I have a very unappealing website!
