       <p class="second-font">"These two women have inspired me, challenged my thinking, made me laugh out loud in inappropriate places, and kept me company on many road trips. This is a book you deserve, your girlfriends deserve, your guy friends deserve, and more. Women will not be fully equal with men until we can talk about sexuality openly and without shame. The world will be better for it!"</p><br/>

       <p class="second-font">"Krystyna and Corinne (both  comedians and feminists) run a successful podcast called Guys We Fucked: The Anti Slut-shaming Podcast. They continue the fun in this book. They talk about numerous subjects dealing with sex and relationships while keeping a sense of humor about it all. I found it to be intriguing and I love the feminist no shame angle to the book. Some patrons might be put off by the language but if they listen to the podcast, they know what to expect."</p>
