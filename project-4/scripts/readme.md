## Project 4: RWD

1. The main content of the page lies within the center box (green).
   I had trouble with the size of my boxes. I couldn't figure out how to get
   the header box to be smaller and the green box to be the focal point.

2. I want to main area of the page to be drawn to the center green box,
   the box that holds the information.

3. The primary content is the 3 boxes that hold information.

4. The secondary content is a spiraled background, which is usually how
   my brain looks after this class!

This is the layout I wanted, but couldn't achieve with the ordering.
