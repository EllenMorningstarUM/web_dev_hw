# Instructable Read.me Part 1

## Ellen Morningstar (Previously Kearns, I know this is probably confusing)

**Overview** - I found this week to be a little more difficult due to proper structure. I struggled with getting my code to look perfect. I also have these weird large gap breaks between my codes that appear on my preview. I'm not sure how to fix it. I did google it, but the answers online read to me like japanese. So that was complicated!


**Improvements** - I know I can improve on proper structure and how it should look on screen in a text edit type formart. I think my biggest confusion was going through the class materials as they only reference structure when showing how to display something. For example: and the example of an Unordered List tag only shows the unordered list. It doesn't show how it would look inside of a full webpage. That's where I got caught up between the heading, the body and the end.
