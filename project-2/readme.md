# Instructable Read.me Part 1

## Ellen Morningstar (Previously Kearns, I know this is probably confusing)

**Overview** - I found this week to be a little more difficult due to proper structure. I struggled with getting my code to look perfect. I also have these weird large gap breaks between my codes that appear on my preview. I'm not sure how to fix it. I did google it, but the answers online read to me like japanese. So that was complicated!


**Improvements** - I know I can improve on proper structure and how it should look on screen in a text edit type formart. I think my biggest confusion was going through the class materials as they only reference structure when showing how to display something. For example: and the example of an Unordered List tag only shows the unordered list. It doesn't show how it would look inside of a full webpage. That's where I got caught up between the heading, the body and the end.

**Overview** - This week was filled with an overload of information, I'm a little burnt out. It's good to know how submit forms work and the hierarchy of going to and from pages within the directory. It wasn't a terrible week, just way more information that I was able to process for one project.


**Improvements** - I'm still trying to get use to the preview on atom vs the published website. I feel like my structure is better this time around, however working between forms in the directory can be confusing. I guess it's all part of the learning curve!

## Ellen Morningstar (Kearns)

**Overview** - I'm glad we have finished up this project, I did enjoy learning everything, but my brain is officially exhausted. I enjoyed learning how to frame audio/video and maps this is very useful! However, Atom has proven to be quite challenging with it's on-again, off-again attitude if it wants you to see a successful preview!

**Improvements** - Coding...in general, it makes me feel old. As much as it pains me to have to code, I really do wish I could be better at it. I seem to struggle and even though the struggle is all a means of learning, struggling can be frustrating!
