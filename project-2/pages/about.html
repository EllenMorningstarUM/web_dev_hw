    <h3>WHY BISCUITS?</H3>
    <p> Every rancher, farmer, or individual understands the comfort a warm,
      buttery biscuit can bring. Whether you moved cows all day, worked the
      fenceline from dawn to dusk or just visited your Grandma's for a quick
      dinner; there's just something about a warm meal. A warm meal with biscuits
      as a premiere fixin'.</p>

      <h3>THE PROCESS!</h3>
      <p> The process of creating this specific instructable website had its challenges
        and most definitely has its accomplishments. When dividing out everything we
        had to learn for this project, the rough numbers are about 121 code items,
        attributes and elements. Pretty crazy!</p>

        <h3>WHAT I LEARNED:</h3>
        <p> I learned that HTML is either your best friend or your worst enemy.
          It will either give you mercy or provide you with keyboard breaking
          grievances. Survival was the success, a very vanilla website was the result!
          I'm looking forward to moving away from HTML and getting into the meat and potatoes with CSS and Java!</p>
